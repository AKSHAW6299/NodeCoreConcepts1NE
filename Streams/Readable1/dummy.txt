The Indian Army is the land-based branch of the Indian Armed Forces and one of the largest standing armies in the world. It was officially established on 1 April 1895, and after independence in 1947, it became the backbone of India’s defense system. Its primary duty is to safeguard the nation’s borders, maintain peace and security, and assist during emergencies like natural disasters.

The Indian Army is known for its bravery, discipline, and selfless service. Soldiers often work in harsh conditions, whether it is the scorching deserts of Rajasthan or the freezing heights of Siachen Glacier. Their sacrifices ensure that citizens can live safely and peacefully.

Apart from defending the nation, the Indian Army also participates in United Nations peacekeeping missions and provides humanitarian aid during floods, earthquakes, and other calamities. The motto of the Indian Army is “Service Before Self”, which reflects its values of duty, honor, and courage.

The Indian Army is not only a symbol of strength but also a source of pride and inspiration for every Indian. It reminds us of the importance of patriotism, unity, and dedication toward the nation.
